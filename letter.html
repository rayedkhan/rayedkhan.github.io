i have this distinct memory from a couple weeks ago. i was sat up thinking in my bed, that my life’s probably never been better than it currently is. and it’s true. it hasn’t.

it does feel a little full circle i won’t lie. we’ve spoken before, but we never really ‘spoke’ - until nearly exactly a year ago, at nishu’s wedding dinner.

i know the cliche here is to say that i’ve loved every minute of our time/journey since, but i haven’t. i mean, really, who does? but i do love where we’ve ended up, regardless of the route. 

you’ve grown to be, really, all three of you, one of my best friends in life. and i love that.

i love hearing about your days annie. i admire how passionate you get with things, and how you insist on living life ‘outside’. 

i love all our film talk so much judie. someone to obsess over modern family with. someone who’d relate to being as shy.

and ruthie. well, you’re okay too, i guess. nah i’m just kidding lol. i love playing whatever with you, and you’re my favorite artist. my ideal company.

you guys really are such a major part of the reason why life feels so good to me right now. at long last. and i’m grateful.

so thank you. 

wish you a merry merry Christmas annie, judith and ruth! 

i hope you never lose your smiles ❤️
